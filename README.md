# GANs
This repository contains work done on GANs.
In the notebook model is trained for 10 epochs only, but on the local machine I have trained the model till 100 epochs. Therefore, generated images are shared in the attached folder.

**Fix Plot**: This folder contains images that are generated by generator during training while keeping the latent points/vector fixed throughout. Also, in case of discriminator the real images are kept fixed and then change in output probabilities is observed.

**Generator Training:** This folder contains images generated by generator at the end of training for each epoch. This is useful to track the training progress of GANs
